# Computer Graphics Undergraduate Course Projects

## Midterm Presentation
This folder is a demo application in which I copied contents from an obj file of a cube, built using Blender, and rendered it using webgl. I then used matrix multiplication to show the basic transformations that can be done to the cube.

To run simply open the index.html file in a browser.

## Final Project
This project aimed towards doing our own research outside of class to find an additional concept and apply it to computer graphics. In my case, I used Perlin noise to generate 2D height map-based images, then applied the same concept to generating Terrains along with color coding a texture map, using Three.js. Finally, I briefly explored how one can use different functions with exponentials, sine, and piecewise functions to have finer control over the desired generated terrain (supplemented with a written paper "Shannon W - Procedural Generation of Terrain Using Perlin Noise").

To run you can open index.html to view early experiments, and terrain.html to view the terrain generation implemented. Be aware as the terrain has 16,384 vertices! You can see a video demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JudMSgwuktM.
