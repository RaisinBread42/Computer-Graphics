# Computer Graphics Undergraduate Course Projects

## Midterm Presentation
This folder is a demo application in which I copied contents from an obj file of a cube, built using Blender, and rendered it using webgl. I then used matrix multiplication to show the basic transformations that can be done to the cube.

## Final Project
This project aimed towards doing our own research outside of class to find an additional concept and apply it to computer graphics. In my case, I used Perlin noise to generate 2D height map-based images, then applied the same concept to generating Terrains along with color coding a texture map, using Three.js.
